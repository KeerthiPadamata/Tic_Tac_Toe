# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking "X" or "O" in empty squares. The objective is to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
